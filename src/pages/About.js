                    Out of vague curiosity and a free slot in my schedule during my senior year of undergrad, I took my first programming course.
                    Fast-forward two years later and writing code has become a daily fascination for me, whether doing daily LeetCode problems or working on my latest program idea.
                    After all of the time I've spent going down the rabbit hole, there is still an entire world left to discover and I'm excited to stumble upon that next educational endeavor.

                    During my senior year in undergrad I took my first programming course out of vague curiosity and a free slot in my schedule.
                    Fast-forward two years later and writing code has become a staple in my everyday life, whether doing daily LeetCode problems or learning how to create an idea that came to me in the shower.
                    After all of the time I've spent studying, there is still an entire world left to discover and I'm excited to stumble upon that next educational endeavor.
